# Valkyrie

Valkyrie is a Robot that can cooperate in hospitals with the doctors and nurses to bring Medicine, Cloths, Food for Patients and also Surgical Instrument to the doctors.

## Use Cases 

* **First Phase**
  * move from one source to one destination. Curve and straight line driving.
  
* **Second Phase**
  * It will automatically open security based locked door. 
  
* **Third Phase**
  * It will automatically call and rides elevators. 
  
* **Fourth Phase**
  * Carry and move specified loads
  
* **Fifth Phase**
  * Speed control function to control the speed in different situation or on different roads..e.g. increase speed if it is an emergency
  
* **Sixth Phase**

  * Add Display, that will show humidity,temperature of Environment and Destination name,Product list
  
* **Ninth Phase**
  *  Add Coffee Maker   

* **Final Phase**  
  *  We will try to make Valkyrie Slim.

* **Overview of Valkyrie Hospital Robot construction**  
  *  Thre will be three section in the construction

     1.Drive Unit: In the drive unit there will be some motors with wheels, suspention if nidded, motor driver, microcontroller(esp32) and other electronics parts.

     2.Navigation: For navigation we will use laser sensor for sens the environment. For processing the data we will use NVIDIA TEGRA X1X2/HAVIER.

     3.Load pick-up, Drop-offs: Basically this part is all about the mechanical things. For pickup we can use hock or something like that can pick loads. And also we will need a microcontroller.

* **Overview of Outdoo-Dron construction**  
  *  Thre will be five section in the construction

     1.Drive Unit.

     2.Environment Sense.

     3.Embidded System.
      
     4.Landing - Take-off.
