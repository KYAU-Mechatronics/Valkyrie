**Image Processing:**
The task for Image processing is to detect the cross and its co-ordinates from the word space
and Image Space.

Their is Two Co-ordinate spaces that we have consider for this task.
      1. World space/camera space
      2. Image space

Camera Space: the origin of the camera space is the location of camera senso. There should be
the co-ordinates x, y and Z. These three co-ordinates will determine the the position of the object
from x and y co-ordinates and z co-ordinate will determine the distance from the object to the camera
sensor.

Image Space: Image stores in the camera sensor pixel by pixel as matrix. There for the origin of
camera sensor is the top left pixel. The line of y co-ordinate of the image space start from 0,0 to 1,0; 2,0; 3,0...
and the x co-ordinate start from 0,0 to 0,1; 0,2; 0,3....


**Steps of the task:**
  step1: Detect the object which is basically a cross sign.
  step2: Find the co-ordinate of the object from the Image space.(unit of the co-ordinates: meter)
  step3: Convert-the x,y co-ordinates of the object from Image Space into World space(or camera space).
  step4: Find out the z co-ordinate of the object from Camera space.
  step5: Convert the parameters of co-ordinates into real world parameter.

Note: the parameters we find from the camera space is not the same parameter in the real world.
      the parameters from camera space is much smaller than real world parameters.

=>To get the real word parameters we have know:
  1.The number of camera pixels
  2.The size of pixels.
  3.The power of camera lens

=>Distence from the object:
  We can get the distence of the object usimg the relation between the distence and the size of objectin the image.
  Lower the distence from sensore to the object bigger the size of object in the image.
  
  **For now I am trying to solve the problem with line detection**
  =>Next tasks are:
  step1: Cross detection
  step2: Find the co-ordinate of the cross sign from the Image space.
  step3: Convert-the x,y co-ordinates of the object from Image Space into Camera space.
  step4: Calculate the distance of the cross sign by image processing.
  step5: Convert the parameter of x,y co-ordinates into real world params.
  step6: Camera sizing
