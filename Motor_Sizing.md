* **Motor Sizing For Val:
     As we want to use VDC motor. We have 125W VDc motor in emppapst. The model of the motor is VDC-49.15
     
     Feature of VDC-49.15:
     1. Power=125W 2.Weight=0.59Kg 3.Voltage required=48V 4.Current Required=3.2A 5.Torque=300nMn 6.rpm=400 -min
This motor is much light weight and less expensive and higly reliable.
     But if we want to carry 150kg load(include EV weight) we will need 123Nm torque. To get this torque we can use gearhead. And ebmpapst also provides some gearhead. We will use spur gearhead as it can transform huge torque.  
 
    Gearhead: Flatline 85(Spur gearhead). It can provide us (0.3*454) = 136.2Nm torque that will help us to carry up to 150kg (200kg possible) weight.
